# cron-for-karens

## Introduction

cron-for-karens is a lightweight automation toolkit designed to satisfy repetitive, bureaucratic demands without consuming valuable human attention. Focus on real engineering â€” let the scripts handle the illusion of productivity.

We need to satisfy people who have other roles and functions in society. In most cases it's about reporting and to show that we exist.
