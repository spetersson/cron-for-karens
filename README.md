# cron-for-karens

## Introduction

cron-for-karens is a lightweight automation toolkit designed to satisfy repetitive, bureaucratic demands without consuming valuable human attention. Focus on real engineering â€” let the scripts handle the illusion of productivity.

Point being that engineers want to work on engineering, and less with administrative tasks. However, given that the world consists of more roles than just engineers. We need to satisfy people who have other roles and functions in society. In most cases it's about reporting and to show that we exist.

## What this repo supports

### Slack

Slack is a fairly common tool for handling communications in a corporate environment.

#### Setup

1. Install required python packages

#### Slack scripts

  This script can be used to send reactions on specific messages in specific channels. I recommend using this for humans that require specific attention and confirmations of that you are well and alive.
